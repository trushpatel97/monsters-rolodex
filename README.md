## Project Description
My project proposal of creating a shopping site will allow users to enter credit card information and make actual transactions. It will
also allow customers to do the essential of every website allows one to do (i.e. login/signup). It will use an API called STRIPE and FIREBASE
to add payments and social media login ability respectively. The shopping site will also allow you to add items to a cart, remove items from a 
cart, or even specify the number of items you want. Once the customer is satisfied with their order and payment is recieved, we can use services
such as MailChimp to inform us that a customer has successfully made a purchase and where it should be shipped.

## Educational Goals
Making a shopping site is an essential for every business. Often times you are working in a team either Front-End or Back-End development or both (Fullstack).
Therefore, it requires a lot of team effort and communication, which is a very important skill for this class. As "software" is usually worked with a team.
Shopping sites continually have to do project management to assure security is up-to-date and bugs are fixed if any are found. Version control is also important
because every year there are no ways to enchance a website. For example, look 20 years back... websites looked boring. There are always constant improvement and
more efficient ways to do something. React for example. It allowed developers to write code once, and reuse it to make cards (pictures of items you see on a site). 
Builds are just as important because often times you pitch a shopping site, and the owners might want some other features added into like permitting the owner to have
admin roles to the site so he/she can add items themselves without coding.

## Project Contribution
This project has to be made from scratch as it's an individual proposal. My contribution so far is that I have researched how we can go about doing this project.
I've found that this project can be done in a timely manner if we use a Javascript library called 'React' which allows us to create components that can be reused anywhere in the
website. Once the component is made, it basically acts like a function. I also researched how we can handle payments, and this can be possible using an API called STRIPE. 
Then if a user wants to login or signup through facebook or gmail, we can use FIREBASE which allows us to login as such. 

## How to build/run the project
To create a react project, we simply cd into the place we want to create the project. Then in the terminal, type "npx create-react-app (name the project)"
to create the project. Once it is done downloading the required packages/installations, then we cd into that project. Finally type "npm start", and the website
should open in a new window on a browser.
